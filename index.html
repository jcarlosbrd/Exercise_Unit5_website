        <p>The world of <strong>The Witcher</strong> is as complex,
            dark and rich as our own, and nothing ever stays the same
            in <strong>the Continent</strong> for too long.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there is a mysterious group of monster hunters
            to protect the common folks from (most) threats.</p>
